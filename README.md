# RL-survival-env-and-agent
An environment in which an agent has to learn to survive with Q-learning.

Hi ! 
That environment is a grid in which you have holes and ground (trees have the same properties as ground, they just make the grid prettier). The idea is that the agent learns how not to fall, with Q-learning.

If you want to train the agent for 5000 times, you don't have to touch anything in the code, BUT you have to add to the folder the file 'graphics.py' which can easily be found on the internet. Once it's done, just go to the folder with your favorite terminal and type 'python Agent.py' !

If you want to see how a single game is played, uncomment the function 'just_watch_a_game()'. 

Enjoy !
